Author: Lisa Avery
Maintainer: Lisa Avery <lisa.avery@uhn.ca>
Description: A small group of functions to read in a data dictionary and the
    corresponding data table from Excel and to automate the cleaning, recoding
    and creation of simple calculated variables. This package was designed to
    be a companion to the macro-enabled DataDictionary.xlsm template available
    on the github site, but works with any similarly-formatted Excel data.
