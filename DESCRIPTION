Description: A small group of functions to read in a data dictionary and the
    corresponding data table from 'Excel' and to automate the cleaning, re-coding
    and creation of simple calculated variables. This package was designed to
    be a companion to the macro-enabled 'Excel' template available
    on the GitHub site, but works with any similarly-formatted 'Excel' data.
